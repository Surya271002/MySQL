# MySQL
Welcome to MySQL project, where I showcase hands-on projects demonstrating my expertise in data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA). In the Data Cleaning, I performed essential data cleaning tasks such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing data for analysis. In the EDA, I conducted exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that drive informed business decisions.
